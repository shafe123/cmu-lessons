# Suggestions / tips:
- Most questions should generally focus on one concept/idea
- Build up in order from easy to difficult across sections
- At the higher end, provide content that challenges peoples' assumptions about code
- Create well-defined problems but don't prescribe solutions
- Break these suggestions when needed

# Structure:
1. Basic multiple choice
2. Fill in blank
3. Read / interpret code (multiple choice, short answer, etc)
4. Open-ended problems

# The process:
1. Create a branch off the `quizzes` branch with the name `quiz/{unit_no}`.
2. Copy the `template.ipynb` file
3. Rename to the format `{unit_no}_{topic}.ipynb` e.g., `02_control_flow_strings.ipynb` for unit 2
4. Create as many questions / problems as needed
5. Commit and push
6. Create a pull request to the `quizzes` branch
