    "This solution combines string parsing with the use of appropriate data structures for storing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A **dictionary** (`tool_locations`) is the natural choice to map a unique identifier (the Tool ID) to its data (the location).\n",
    "2.  For each string, we use a `try-except` block to gracefully handle any malformed lines without crashing. Inside the `try` block, we split the string into parts. We parse these parts to extract the tool ID and the integer components of the location.\n",
    "3.  The location `(bay, shelf, slot)` is stored as a **tuple**. This is a deliberate choice that reflects a key objective: tuples are **immutable**. A tool's storage location should be a fixed, unchangeable piece of data, making a tuple a more robust and appropriate choice than a list for this purpose."

    "The solution uses `dict.setdefault(key, [])`, which is a very convenient method for this pattern. For each `reading` tuple, it ensures that a list exists for the given `sensor_id`. If the key is new, `setdefault` creates an empty list `[]` for it. The code then appends the `(timestamp, value)` **tuple** to that list. This is more concise than checking if the key exists before appending."
