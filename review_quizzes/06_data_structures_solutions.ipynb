    "\n",
    "1.  A **dictionary** (`tool_locations`) is the natural choice to map a unique identifier (the Tool ID) to its data (the location).\n",

    "3.  The location `(bay, shelf, slot)` is stored as a **tuple**. This is a deliberate choice that reflects a key objective: tuples are **immutable**. A tool's storage location should be a fixed, unchangeable piece of data, making a tuple a more robust and appropriate choice than a list for this purpose."

The solution iterates through each `component` dictionary in the `component_specs` list, calculates the `total_draw`, and if it exceeds `power_threshold_watts`, adds the component's ID to the set.

    "This problem involves transforming a flat **list of tuples** into a **dictionary of lists**, which is a common data grouping task. The goal is to create a dictionary where each key is a sensor ID and each value is a list of all readings from that sensor.\n",

    "The solution uses `dict.setdefault(key, [])`, which is a very convenient method for this pattern. For each `reading` tuple, it ensures that a list exists for the given `sensor_id`. If the key is new, `setdefault` creates an empty list `[]` for it. The code then appends the `(timestamp, value)` **tuple** to that list. This is more concise than checking if the key exists before appending."
